When a hungry worm reaches a tree, it consumes the leaves in order. The premise, rules, and objective of the worm and leaves puzzle are given below:-

Premise – DAY 1: The worm consumes one leaf.
TWICE(DAY 1)= 2 leaves on day 2
TWICE(DAY 2)=4 leaves on day 3
DAY 4: DOUBLE (DAY 3) = 8 leaves, and so forth…. (up to 30 days)
Rules – The above eating pattern continues for 30 days, and on the 30th day, all of the leaves are consumed.
Objective – When did the worm eat exactly half of the total number of leaves?

Solution:-
To make the math easier, we’ll use a total period of 4 days rather than 30 days.

DAY ONE: The worm consumes one leaf.
The worm consumes two leaves on 2nd day.
The worm consumes 4 leaves 3rd day.
The worm consumes 8 leaves on 4th day.

Total Number of Leaves Consumed
On the fourth day, all of the leaves are done. As a result, there are a total of 15 leaves (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15).
Total Number of Leaves on the Tree
(15/2 = 7.5) is just half of the total number of leaves on the tree.
The worm can finish a total of 7 leaves by the end of day 3.
As a result, only half of the total number of leaves on the tree can be completed on day 4, the final day.
As a result, the overall time length of the supplied riddle is 30 days.
Therefore, the Conclusion is:-
On Day 30, i.e. the last day, the worm consumes exactly half of the total number of leaves.
