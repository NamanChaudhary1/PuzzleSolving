Problem:-
There are 2 jugs with 4 litres and 5 litres of water respectively. The objective is to pour exactly 7 litres of water in a bucket. How can it be accomplished?

Solution:-
This question can be rated of medium difficulty and shouldnâ€™t ideally take more than 2 minutes to answer. 
The approach here is to initially fill the 5L jug with water and empty the same into the 4L jug.
The 5L jug will be left with 1L of water, which is poured into the bucket. 
Meanwhile, empty the 4L jug.
The above step is repeated, so that the bucket now is filled with 2L of water. 
Finally, fill the 5L jug with water and empty the same into the bucket. 
The bucket will now have 7L of water, as you add % L directly to the previously collected 2L of water in the bucket.
