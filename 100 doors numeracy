there are 100 doors in a single row that are all closed. You make 100 passes by each door, starting at the first door each time. 
On the first time you pass, you visit every door, and if it's closed, you open it, and if it's open, you close it.
On your second pass by, you only visit every other door, starting from the second door in line so that you're skip-counting the doors by two.
The third pass you go to every third door, the fourth pass every fourth door, and so on until you have only passed by the hundredth door. 
During your last pass by, which of the doors are still open and which ones are closed?

Solution:-
For every door you pass, you pass it the same number of times as the divisors in the door's number. 
For instance, if you pass by door 38, you can find the divisors of 38 as one, two, 19, 38 and so on. 
Therefore, on your first visit, you open the door, 
then on the second pass you close it, on your 19th pass you open it and on the 38th visit you close it.
