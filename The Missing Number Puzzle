In this puzzle, you are given an array of numbers from 1 to N, where one number is missing. Your task is to find the missing number in the most efficient way possible.

Answer : One of the efficient ways to solve this puzzle is by using the mathematical formula for the sum of consecutive integers. Calculate the expected sum of the given range (from 1 to N) using the formula (N * (N + 1)) / 2. Then, iterate through the array and subtract each element from the expected sum. The remaining value will be the missing number.
