There are 1000 wine bottles. 
One of the bottles contains poisoned wine.
A rat dies after one hour of drinking the poisoned wine. 
How many minimum rats are needed to figure out which bottle contains
poison in hour. 

Solution: 
We need to figure out in hour. We need 10 rats to figure out the
poisoned bottle. The result is based on binary number system.
We get 10 using ⌈ Log21000 ⌉. 

The idea is to number bottles from 1 to 1000 and write their 
corresponding binary numbers on the bottle. Each rat is assigned a position in the 
binary numbers written on bottles. Let us take an example. Rat 1 represents 
first bit in every bottle, rat 2 represents second bit and so on. 
f rat numbers 2, 4 and 6 die, then bottle number 42 (Binary 0000101010) is poisoned.
