You are on the side of the river. You are given a m liter jug and a n liter jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d liters of water in one of jug. 
The operations you can perform are: 

Empty a Jug
Fill a Jug
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.



SOLUTION:-
Fill the n liter jug and empty it into m liter jug.
Whenever the n liter jug becomes empty fill it.
Whenever the m liter jug becomes full empty it.
Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 till either n liter jug or the m liter jug contains d liters of water.
(0,0)->(0,5)->(3,2)->(0,2)->(2,0)->(2,5)->(3,4)

Hence the no of operations you need to perform are 6.
