There are ten bandits named as ’A’, ‘B’ ,‘C’ ,‘D’ ,‘E’ ,‘F’ ,‘G’ ,‘H’ ,‘I’ ,‘J’  they stole some precious stones from a temple,
and they decided to divide these stones equally among themselves. 
So they split the stones into ten parts,but the last bandit,‘J’got one stone less than other bandits.
So the remaining nine bandits murder‘J’.They again decided to divide the stones into nineparts.
But this timeagain,thelastbandit‘I’gotoneless stonethanotherbandits.Soagain,

This process goes on until 1 bandit is left,i.e.,‘A’.
After that,‘A’takes all the stones and runs away. Now you have to guess the total number of stones.

Solution:-
If there was 1 more stone in a first attempt, the stones could be easily divided among 10 bandits.
And in the second attempt also the stones could be equally divided among 9 bandits and so on. 
So let's just add one stone to the total number of stones. So the total stones become N+1.
Now this (N+1) should be divisible by 10. It should be divisible by 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
So our answer should be LCM of (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). 
Total Number of stones = LCM of (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) which is 2520. 
Now we have to subtract 1 stone which we have added before, so the total number of stones is 2519.
