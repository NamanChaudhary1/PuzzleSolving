A blind man is alone in a house. 
He has two blue pills and two red pills. 
He must take exactly one red pill and one blue pill or he will die. How does he do it?

Solution:-
●Firstly, break each of the pills in half 
●As you do this, take one half in your mouth and lay the other half aside for tomorrow. 
●When he’s done this with all four pills he will have consumed one red pill and one blue pill.
And have the same leftovers.
