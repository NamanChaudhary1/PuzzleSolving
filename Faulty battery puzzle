There are 8 batteries, but only 4 of them work. 
You have to use them for a flashlight which needs only 2 working batteries. 
To guarantee that the flashlight is turned on,
what is the minimum number of battery pairs you need to test?


Solution:-
To solve this problem, the first step involves naming the batteries, for instance,
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. In this problem, you can’t compare 2 items directly. 
If a combination of two batteries fail to turn the light on,
it means either one or both the batteries aren’t working.
The candidate has to approach the puzzle in a circular manner.

The batteries are put test consecutively in the order AB, BC, and AC. 
At most, one of the three batteries between A, B, And C is working, only if none of the pairs work.
This also implies that at least three batteries between D, E, F, G, and H must be functional.
DE combination is tried next.
If they don’t work, at least 2 out of F, G, and H must work.
Similarly, try the combinations FG, GH, and FH to positively asset which batteries really work.
