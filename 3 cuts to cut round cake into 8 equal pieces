Puzzle: You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces by making 3 cuts only. How do you do it?

Solution: The solution can be divided into 3 basic steps. But apart from this there are also other method of executing this task.
Step 1: Cut the cake into quarters (4 pieces) using 2 of the cuts – 
one horizontally down the centre of the cake and the other vertically down the centre of the cake. This will leave you with 4 pieces (or slices) of cake.
Step 2: Then take all 4 pieces and arrange them in a stack that is 4 pieces high.
Step 3: Finally, you can just cut that stack of 4 pieces in half – using your third and final cut – and then you will end up with 8 pieces of cake!
