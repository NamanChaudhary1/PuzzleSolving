 There are 3 mislabeled jars, with apple and oranges in the first and second jar respectively.
 The third jar contains a mixture of apples and oranges.
 You can pick as many fruits as required to precisely label each jar.
 Determine the minimum number of fruits to be picked up in the process of labeling the jars.
 
 Sol:-
 This is another tricky puzzle where you must really churn your brain.
 A noticeable aspect in this puzzles is the fact that there’s a circular misplacement,
 which implies if apple is wrongly labelled as Apple, Apple can’t be labelled as Orange, i.e.,
 it has to be labeled as A+O. We are acquainted with the fact that everything is wrongly placed, 
 which means A+O jar contains either Apple or Orange (but not both). The candidate picks one fruit from A+O, 
 and let’s assume he gets an apple. He labels the jar as apple, however, jar labelled Apple can’t have A+O.
 Thus, the third jar left in the process should be labelled A+O. Basically, picking only one fruit helps in correctly labeling the jars.
