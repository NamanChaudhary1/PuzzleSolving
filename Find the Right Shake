You have three bottles of milkshakes that are all mislabelled. 
One contains Oreoshake, another Kitkatshake, and the third has a mix of both in random proportion.
How many minimum shakes would you have to taste to find out how to match the jars’ labels correctly?
●A- Oreo Shake 
●B- KitKat Shake 
●C- Oreo-KitKat Shake (random proportion)

Solution :-
We know that all bottles are mislabelled,i.e.
Bottle A labelled as Oreo Shake is not OreoShake,
and the same goes for all the other bottles. 
Take a sip from the MixBottle,i.e.
Bottle C .We know that it is not the mixed shake as it is mislabeled,
so if it is the Oreoshake,then Bottle A is KitKat, since Bottle B is mislabeled as KitKat, 
and therefore Bottle B is Mixed. Similarly,Bottle C isKitKat.
Bottle B isOreo as Bottle A can’t be Oreo [mislabeled as Oreo].
Therefore Bottle A is mixed. So we can correctly label the bottles in one tasting.
