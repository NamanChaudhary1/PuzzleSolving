Puzzle: There are two gates, one to hell and the other to heaven. Two gatekeepers, one for each gate. One of them always speaks the truth and the other always lies but you don’t know which one guards which gate. You are allowed only one question and you need to find out the gate to heaven.
What is the question? 

Answer: Ask any guard “What would the other guard say if I ask which way is to the hell ?” And whatever answer he give is the way to the heaven. Explanation: If you end up asking the question to the truthful one, he will speak the truth and he knows that other guard is going to lie so he will show the way to the heaven. If you end up asking the question to the liar, he will lie about the other and the answer will be the way to the heaven.
