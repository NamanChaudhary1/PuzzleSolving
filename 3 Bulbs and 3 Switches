There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs. Outside the room, there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. 
You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but once you open the door you canâ€™t change them.
Identify each switch with its bulb. All bulbs are in working condition.

Answer:-

Turn on switch X for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn it off and turn on switch Y. Open the door and touch the light bulb. 
1. the light is on from the bulb, it is Y 

Now we will check the other two off bulbs 
2. the bulb which is hot, is X 
3. the bulb which is cold, is Z
