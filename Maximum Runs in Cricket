n Maximum Runs in Cricket Puzzle, we have a one-day international cricket match.
In a one-day international cricket match, 
considering no extras(no wide, no ‘no’ balls, etc.) and no overthrows.
What is the maximum number of runs that a batsman can score in an ideal case?


Solution:-
 From Over 1 to 49:

 In singe over we get –

In 1st ball, we get :- 6 runs (hit six)
In 2nd ball, we get :- 6 runs (hit six)
In 3rd ball, we get :- 6 runs (hit six)
In the 4th ball we get:- 6 runs (hit six)
In the 5th ball we get:- 6 runs (hit six)
In the 6th ball we get:- 3 runs (took 3 runs between the wickets and take back the strike)
  Therefore, Total Run in 49 overs will be = 49*(6*5+3)

  Now in 50th Over: Hit six sixes in a row, so total runs will be –

 49*(6*5+3)+(6*6)= 1653
