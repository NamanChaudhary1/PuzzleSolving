To achieve this score, the batsman can hit sixes (6 runs) off the first five balls of each over and take three runs off the last ball. This totals 33 runs per over.

Since there are 50 overs in a match, the total runs can be calculated as follows:

50 overs x 33 runs per over = 1650 runs

However, we also need to consider the runs scored in the last over. In the last over, the batsman can hit sixes off the first five balls (30 runs) and take three runs off the last ball. This adds an additional 33 runs.

Therefore, the total maximum score would be:

1650 runs (throughout the match) + 33 runs (last over) = 1683 runs


CODE--------------->
def calculate_maximum_runs():
    runs_per_over = 33  # Runs scored per over
    total_runs = 0
    overs = 50

    # Calculate runs for all full overs
    total_runs += runs_per_over * (overs - 1)

    # Calculate runs for the last over
    total_runs += runs_per_over + 3  # Add 3 runs for the last ball

    return total_runs


maximum_runs = calculate_maximum_runs()
print("Maximum runs a batsman can score: ", maximum_runs)
