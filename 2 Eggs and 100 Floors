Given below are a puzzle based on 2 eggs and 100 floors building. Let’s see the following:

There is a 100 floors building. 

There are two possible scenes we need to analyze:

If an egg drops from the N’th floor or above it will break.
If it’s dropped from any floor below ‘N’, it will not break
Note: You’re given only 2 eggs 

Questions:

1 – Find the N’th floor.

2 – How many drops do you need to make?

3 – What should be the best strategy to minimize the number of egg drops?

Solution:-
Let’s start the method from the 10th floor and go up to 10 floors at a time.

What we have to do:

Step 1: Throw the egg from the 10th floor, and if it breaks, then we can conclude that the ‘N’ floor is between 1-9.

Step 2: Repeat the same process if the egg is unbroken on the 10th, and now throw it from the 20th floor. Repeat the process until the 100th floor.

Step 3: So, even if the first egg is unbroken, we can now try the second egg and throw it from floors 91 – 99.

Let’s count the drops:

10 drops on each 10th floor (1 – 100)
9 drops in between the floors (91 – 99)
So, the number of drops in the worst-case scenario is 19.
