Problem:-
Three ants are in the corners of an equilateral triangle. 
Each ant moves in a random direction along the edges of the triangle. 
What is the probability that none of the ants collide with the triangle?


Solution:-
There's a 50% chance of the ants never meeting and a 50% that at least two can collide.
So, the ants all can move in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction,
which then splits your first 50% chance of the ants not colliding down to a 25% chance because half of 50 is 25.
