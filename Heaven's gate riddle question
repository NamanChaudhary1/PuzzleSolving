Problem:-
"You're standing in front of two doors. One door is the 'right' door, and the other is the 'wrong' door.
There are two guards, one standing by each door. 
One guard always tells the truth and the other always tells a lie. 
You don't know which guard lies or tells the truth. 
You can only ask one question to each guard to find the 'right' door.
What is the question to ask?"


Solution:-
You can ask either guard,
'If I ask the other guard which door is the "right" one, 
what would they say?' 
Because each guard's answer inevitably points to the 'wrong' door,
you can then choose the opposite door.
