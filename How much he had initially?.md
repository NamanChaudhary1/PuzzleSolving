1st Temple: As soon as he enters the temple, his money is doubled to 2x. On his way out he donates Rs. 100. Therefore, he is left with Rs. Rs. (2x – 100).

2nd Temple: As soon as he enters the temple, his money is doubled to 2(2x – 100). On his way out he donates another Rs. 100 and he is left out with Rs. (4x – 300)

3rd Temple: As soon as he enters the temple, his money is doubled to 2(4x – 300). On his way out he donates another Rs. 100 and he is left with Rs. (8x – 700)

4th Temple: As soon as he enters the temple, his money is doubled to 2(8x – 700). On his way out he donates another Rs. 100 and he is left with Rs. (16x – 1500).

According to the question, after his last visit, he completely runs out of money.
Therefore,
=> 16x - 1500 = 0;
=> x = 1500/16;
=> x = 93.75
