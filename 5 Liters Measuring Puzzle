On this page you’ll come across the puzzle where you need to measure 5 liters of water in one of the jars that are provided to you.

You are given four different jars of different capacities – 2 liters, 4 liters, 6 liters, and 8 liters respectively with an unlimited water supply. 

Then you are asked to measure exactly 5 liters of water using all of them.

Question:

How will you do it?

Solution:-
We have 4 jars of water.
Size  of jars —-> 2 L, 4 L, 6 L, and 8 L.
Water supply is unlimited.

Step 1:
We have 4 jars, of different size.
First we need to fill the 4-Liters jar completely.
Now, empty it in the 6-Liters jar.
Now, 4 liters jar is empty and 6 Liters jar is filled up to 4 liters.
Fill the 4 liters jar again.
So now, we have 4 liters water in both the jars i.e., 4 liters and 6 liters respectively.

Step 2:
Next, take both the 4 liters and 6-liter jars, and pour both of them into 2-liter empty jar at the same rate.
Now, as we are emptying both the jar at the same rate, the 2-liter jar will be filled completely
This leaves both 4 liters and 6-liter jar containing only 3 liters each.

Step 3:
Use either of the 4 liters or 6-liter jar which has 3 liters of water and use the 2-liter jar filled with water to fill the 8-liter jar.
Finally, the 8-liter jar has 5 liters of water in it as asked.
