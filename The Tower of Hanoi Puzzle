The Tower of Hanoi puzzle consists of three pegs and a set of disks of different sizes.
The disks are initially stacked in ascending order of size on one peg, 
with the smallest disk on top. The objective is to move the entire stack to another peg, 
obeying the following rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, 
each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack,
and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Answer : use a recursive algorithm known as the "divide and conquer" : 
(1) Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg.
(2) Move the largest disk from the source peg to the destination peg.
(3) Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.
